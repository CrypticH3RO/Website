		Piazza is a free online gathering place where students can ask, answer, and explore under the guidance of 
		their instructors. I assisted many of my peers on Piazza and as a result, I became the top student contributor
		in my CSCA48 class.

		<!-- Describing more of myself -->
		In early 2017, I participated in the International Mathematical Modeling Challenge(IMMC), where my
		team and I were expected to create an effective solution for a real-world problem within a short timeframe. 
		My team and I held multiple brainstorming sessions throughout the five days, discussing methods of approach and potential solutions to the problem.
		We then divided the work into even parts and assigned a segment of the work to each person. 
		I efficiently completed my part and used my extra time to help my teammates complete their segments optimally. 
		Afterwards, we presented our solution to the Fields Institute MathEd Forum in an organized and conceivable way. 
		In the end, our exhaustive efforts allowed us to win the Canadian Best Paper Award.
